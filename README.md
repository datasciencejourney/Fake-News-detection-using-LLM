# Fake-News-detection-using-LLM
This repository contains an AI-driven solution to combat misinformation by detecting fake news using Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project classifies news articles as real or fake. It serves as a robust tool to analyze and assess the credibility of information in today's digital age.

Features
State-of-the-Art Models: Utilizes transformers-based LLMs (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for text classification.
Data-Driven Insights: Incorporates data preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization to uncover patterns in the dataset.
Custom Fine-Tuning: Fine-tunes pre-trained models for fake news detection using labeled datasets.
Robust Evaluation: Includes performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.
Interactive Notebook: Modular and well-documented Jupyter Notebook for exploration and learning.
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Required Libraries
Install dependencies via the requirements file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If no requirements.txt is available, install the following manually:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn transformers matplotlib seaborn
Repository Setup
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fake-News-Detection-LLM.git
cd Fake-News-Detection-LLM
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Dataset
The project uses a labeled dataset of news articles with annotations for real and fake news.

Source: Kaggle or a custom dataset.
Structure:
Title: The headline of the news article.
Text: The full content of the article.
Label: Binary labels (1 for fake, 0 for real).
Note: You can replace the dataset with your own for custom use cases.

Model Architecture
Base Model: Pre-trained transformer models such as BERT or RoBERTa.
Fine-Tuning: The base model is fine-tuned on the labeled dataset for binary classification.
Pipeline:
Tokenization: Convert text into token IDs using model-specific tokenizer.
Model Training: Fine-tune pre-trained weights on labeled data.
Prediction: Use the fine-tuned model for inference on new data.
Usage
Running the Notebook
Load the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Fake_News_Detection_using_LLM.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to:
Preprocess the dataset.
Train and evaluate the model.
Visualize results.
Making Predictions
You can use the fine-tuned model as follows:

python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the fine-tuned model
classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="path-to-your-model")

# Predict on a sample text
text = "Breaking news: Major breakthrough in AI technology!"
result = classifier(text)
print(result)
Results
Metrics:
Accuracy: 95%
